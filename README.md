Path Fix
========

This module shoud replace chars in urls.

It replaces most non-a-z European chars with a-z.

Todo

* Make it integrate better with pathauto settings pages
* Make it possible to add custom replacement patterns

Inspired by this: http://roberskine.com/blog/custom-punctuation-replacement-in-drupal-7-with-the-path-module/
Thanks for all kode snippets out there :)
